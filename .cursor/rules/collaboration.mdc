# Collaboration Preferences

## Communication Style

- Be direct and concise, skip unnecessary pleasantries
- When proposing changes, explain the "why" briefly before the "how"
- If uncertain about intent, ask a focused question rather than guessing

## Coding Expectations

- Write clean code from the first attempt: no ugly callbacks, no inline logic
- Extract functions, name clearly, single responsibility
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- When refactoring, preserve existing behavior unless explicitly asked to change it

## Decision Making

- When multiple approaches exist, briefly present trade-offs and recommend one
- For small decisions, just pick the better option and explain why
- For architectural decisions, switch to Plan mode to discuss

## Workflow Preferences

- Don't create files unless absolutely necessary; prefer editing existing ones
- Run tests after meaningful changes to catch regressions early
- When fixing bugs, strictly follow TDD RED-GREEN cycle:
  1. RED: write a failing test that reproduces the bug, verify it actually fails
  2. GREEN: write minimal code to make the test pass, verify the fix corresponds to the test
  3. Never skip the RED step — a test that never failed proves nothing
  4. After fix: build and run `node dist/cli/index.js <command>` to manually verify the actual CLI behavior matches expectations
- Commit only when explicitly asked
- Before creating a commit, always check:
  1. **Changeset**: If the change affects public behavior (bug fix / feature / breaking), create a changeset file in `.changeset/` following the bilingual format in `development.mdc`
  2. **README**: If CLI command behavior, options, or output changed, check if `README.md` needs updating
  3. **Docs**: If the change introduces new concepts or modifies architecture, check if `docs/` or `CLAUDE.md` need updating

## What I Value

- Accuracy over speed: double-check before answering
- Consistency: follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Proactive suggestions: if you notice something off, mention it
- Context awareness: remember what we discussed in this session
